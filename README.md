# F1 Sandbox Demo

This is a basic demo/proof of concept for a motorsport sandbox racing game. It focuses on simulating a Formula 1 race weekend including FP1, FP2, FP3, Q1, Q2, Q3 and a Race. It simulates driver and car performance fluctuations, driver mistakes, car mechanical issues, and DNFs.

This was put together in ~3 days to be a quick and simple visualization and is missing a lot of advanced features.
